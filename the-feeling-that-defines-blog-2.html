        <h1 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color:black; font-size:4em;">The Feeling that defines #JaiHind </h1>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;"> When it comes to  your country, the place where you live, the place which you must be proud of, you say,"I've my own rules".
            <br>
            Its okay. Its totally okay. I'm not here to judge anyone neither I've the right to do so. But I don't know why but I've always a feeling that my elders have taught me.
            <br>
            In Indian culture, from the first day itself a child is taught to love and respect his/her mother, father and elders and everyone else. We proudly consider our land, our country as mother. It's our culture and I totally don't feel ashamed rather I feel proud at my such beautiful Indian Culture.
            <br>
            India is not just a country, it is emotion and a feeling that we Indians are proud to have. 
            <br>
            Now, you must be wodering about why I am writing all this stuff instead of writing some tech related stuff. So, here is your answer, I'm writing all this to remind myself that I can never be a person who can consider his country as just a mere country.
            <br>
            So, what happened today, I was talking with a person on whatsapp. In some context, when I texted 'Jai Hind', I got a sad emoji in reply.
            <br>
            I felt broken, really shattered and let me be clear that thsi feeling was not because of that person in general.
            <br>
            Sometimes I have a feeling that, is this the same India that Netaji had imagined, probably not.
            <br>
            I have only one thing to say to those people who feel proud in saying that how beloved foreign things are, how much they aspire to get a job abroad and then appreciate about that place. I am not saying that that are bad thing but isn't is a shame to not to hail for your country which provided you the guts to even dream about. 
            <br>
            So that's it.
            <br> 
            If you feel like I am wrong at some point, feel free to talk to me by scheduling a meeting on calendly.
            <br>
            Lets talk in another blog.</p>
